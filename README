# Circa September 2008

This is just a little bit more useful / advanced version of my
previous `JavaBot'.

After experiencing Bucket in the #xkcd, I decided it would be
nice to offer some sort of interactive abilities with the bot,
wherein you could ask a question and the bot would reply with
a reasonable anwser.

Bucket utilized a thing called `Factoid' files. Basically just
associative lists. So! I implemented them in this, as well.

Note, though, that unlike Bucket, there is no support for
interactively adding new Factoids to the definition list. You
have to manually add them and restart the bot for changes to
take affect.
